                <p>
                    I have been working as a data analyst and product owner after graduating from Rutgers University with a degree in Business Analytics and Information Technology. During my time as an analyst I have honed in my skills towards curating products and taking on the role of product owner by leading some major initiatives on my team to enhance our current workflows and better serve our clients. I have lead these initiatives by creating close relationships with some of our largest clients so I can truly understand their needs and the complex ways they think about, use, and conduct business with our product offerings.
                    Throughout my time in the FinTech industry, I have conducted various analyses researching both for internal business intelligence purposes as well as for product research. I have gained subject matter expertise for my product by interacting with the data and its end users on a daily basis and often act as a data consultant. I have completed multiple projects successfully, the most recent of which has the potential for monetization and is currently released in Beta. 
                    Outside of the office I also have a passion for animals and local ecosystems. I have been an animal foster and volunteer for 3 years specializing in rehabilitation and rehoming as well as local TNR. I am also an avid equestrian of over 12 years. Working with animals is a personal passion of mine and has taught me a lot about patience, hard work, and the benefits of careful attention.
